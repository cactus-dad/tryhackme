Proof of Concept code for the Capture! Room on TryHackMe

Steps:
  

 - Download username and passord file to directory where you pull the  
    scripts.   
 - Make sure to change the IP Address to your target
 - Make sure the file in username_enum.py is the same as your username file.

    

 - Run the username_enum.py script, it will highlight the correct   
       username in red as well as create a new file in the directory called
       "success.txt"
 - The correct username is in the password_enum.py, at 
       least it was when I did the room.  Replace it with what you find!

  
    

 - Make sure to change the IP Address to your target
