code and techniques for tryhackme rooms
Proof of Concept code for the Capture! Room on TryHackMe

Steps:
  Download username and passord file to directory where you pull the scripts.
  Make sure to change the IP Address to your target
  Make sure the file in username_enum.py is the same as your username file.
  Run the username_enum.py script, it will highlight the correct username in red as well as create a new file in the directory called "success.txt"
  The correct username is in the password_enum.py, at least it was when I did the room.  Replace it with what you find!
  Make sure to change the IP Address to your target
  Make sure the finle in password_enum.py is the same as your password file
  Run the password_enum.py script, it will highlight the correct password in red as well as append the "success.txt" file
